1. **Start with the Goal**  
   - The process of identifying data begins by understanding the **objective** of your analysis.
   - The information you collect should directly support achieving this goal.

2. **Identify Data Sources**  
   - Once the required data is identified, determine **where to get it from**.
   - Consider:
     - The **timeframe** of data needed
     - The **volume** required for meaningful analysis

3. **Types of Data Sources**

4. **Examples of Data Sources**  
   - Databases  
   - Web data / APIs  
   - Social media platforms  
   - IoT and sensor devices  
   - Surveys and observational studies  
   - Data exchanges and marketplaces

5. **Combining Data**  
   - Use tools and methods (e.g., SQL, ETL pipelines, data warehouses) to **integrate data** 
into a single interface for analysis.

6. **Considerations for Quality and Ethics**  
   - The **origin and handling** of data affect:
     - **Data quality**
     - **Privacy regulations** (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)
